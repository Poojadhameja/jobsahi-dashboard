URGENT: Fix PHP SQL Error - "Unknown column 'i.job_id' in 'ON'"

The `interviews` table does NOT have `job_id` column. Fix this query:

```php
// CURRENT BROKEN QUERY:
$check = $conn->prepare("
    SELECT i.id 
    FROM interviews i
    JOIN applications a ON i.application_id = a.id
    JOIN jobs j ON a.job_id = j.id
    WHERE i.id = ? AND j.recruiter_id = ?
");
```

REQUIREMENT: Verify if interview belongs to recruiter. Provide 4 query options:
1. If `interviews` has `recruiter_id` - check directly
2. If `interviews` has `application_id` - join interviews->applications->jobs  
3. If `interviews` has `student_id` - join interviews->applications(via student_id)->jobs
4. If `interviews` has both - handle NULL application_id

Return complete fixed PHP code with all options commented. NO `i.job_id` usage.
